FRC Vision Simple Tracker Template
--------------------------------

This program is the simplest sample program that implements
an autonomous action (in this case, drive) based on color tracking. 
This is an excellent starting point for your programs.

This program follows a green target during the
Autonomous period and does simple arcade driving during 
the Operator Control period.
